Course Search System

This module provides functionality for searching relevant courses based on user-provided keywords.
It includes a method to determine the similarity between courses and user interests and implements
a relevance measure to list the most relevant courses first.

Typical usage example:

    # Define the keywords, index, and course URLs.
    keywords = ["luminosidad", "enfoque", "composiciÃ³n"]
    index = {...}  # Dictionary containing the index of courses.
    course_urls = {...}  # Dictionary containing course IDs mapped to URLs.

    # Search for relevant courses.
    relevant_courses = search(keywords, index, course_urls)
    print(relevant_courses)  # Output list of relevant course URLs.

"""
